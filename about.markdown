Hi! I'm Kevin, and I am an engineer who loves to tinker with Machine Learning. Right now, my playing field is **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and generative AI.

My journey took a turn when a friend introduced me to **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, trained to generate images of MNIST data—numbers from 0 to 9—during my bachelor's. That moment sparked my fascination with the field of Machine Learning.

I am currently working at Amazon Web Services. Outside work, I love to ice skate and read books when I am tired of doom scrolling.

I'm Kevin, an engineer who enjoys tinkering in the realms of **Machine Learning**, Data Engineering, and, more recently, exploring the world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My journey took a turn when a friend introduced me to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained to generate images of MNIST data—numbers from 0 to 9. That moment sparked my fascination with the field of Machine Learning.

I’m currently interning at [Kinaxis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kinaxis/mycompany/) and actively seeking new opportunities.

Hi! I'm Kevin, and I am an engineer who love to thinker with Machine Learning right now my playing field is **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. 

My journey took a turn when a friend introduced me to **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** trained to generate images of MNIST data—numbers from 0 to 9 during my bachlors. That moment sparked my fascination with the field of Machine Learning.

I’m currently Interning at [Kinaxis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kinaxis/mycompany/).

Outside work I love to do ice-skates and read book when I am tired of Doom Scrolling.
